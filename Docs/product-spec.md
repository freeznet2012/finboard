# FinBoard – Product Specification

## Purpose
FinBoard is a lightweight, visual personal finance dashboard designed to track assets and liabilities—including stocks, gold, mutual funds, bonds, loans, and real estate—without requiring precise imports or integrations.

## Problem Statement
Existing personal finance tools are overly complicated, accuracy-focused, and intimidating for casual users. FinBoard simplifies the experience by allowing manual entry, incomplete data, and approximate values, focusing instead on colorful visual insights.
